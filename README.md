- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hitokri77
- 👀 I’m interested in Martial Arts(pratical, weapon and taolu/kata), becoming a polyglot, philosophy, meditation, and internal growth
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, and CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and everything that will allow me to become better at coding, as this is all brand new to me. After learning the basics I would like to work my way to becoming a full stack developer, and hopefully find a job.
- 📫 How to reach me, dmwarren0616@gmail.com
